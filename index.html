	<ol>
		<li>Create a DonutShop constructor with properties: local, minCustPerHour, maxCustPerHour, averDonutPerCust, operationHour.</li>
		<li>Generated randomNumber, the random number of customer per hour ranged between minCustPerHour and maxCustPerHour.</li>
		<li>Calculate how many donuts will be sold by multiplying the averDonutPerCust and customer number per hour.</li>
		<li>Calculate the total donut counts per day, dountCountPerDay, by adding all the donuts sold per hour.</li>
		<li>Calculate average donuts sold per hour, donutCountPerHour, by dividing dountCountPerDay by the operationHour. </li>
		<li>Display in the console: store location, the total number of the donuts sold at the location, and the average number of the donuts sold per hour at the location. </li>
